											Enefficient API Deployment and Usage Document
											
															Version 1.5

====================================================================================================================================

The Enefficient API uses the Gradle build system to compile all dependencies and compile the Java code itself. All JUnit
test cases are run automatically when gradle builds and the build will only succeed when all test cases pass. 

Do NOT try to run this project as a normal Java eclipse project as this project compiles down to an REST API and is not suited
to run in the eclipse console.

A terminal is required to deploy this run this project.
		
		UNIX Systems	- built-in terminal should function fine
		Windows 		- Command Prompt or Windows Powershell or Git Bash
		
Make sure to cd into the root directory of the project which will look like this:

			├──.gradle
			├──.settings
			├── bin
			├── build
			├── gradle
			├── src
			├──.classpath
			├──.gitignore
			├──.project
			├── build.gradle
			├── Deployment_and_Usage_Instructions
			├── gradlew
			├── gradlew.bat
			├── settings.gradle
			├── build.gradle
			├── settings.gradle
		
The gradle version of this project is 4.6 so if thats installed on your computer, use build option 2.

If you have a different version of gradle or do not have gradle installed at all or you have no idea, use build option 1.

** To check the version of gradle, run the following command on any of the previously mentioned terminals above:
			
			gradle --version

	
Build Option 1 (Preferred): 
			
			gradlew build (cmd prompt)    or   ./gradlew build  (git bash, powershell, UNIX terminals)  or .\gradlew build  (cmd prompt, powershell)
						
Build Option 2: 
	
			gradle build
			

** gradlew uses the wrapper configured with the project that installs the correct version of gradle to your machine


If the by any chance the build does not succeed, the hosted version of the application is available at:
